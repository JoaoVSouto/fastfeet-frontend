## üíª Overview

**FastFeet** is a system for managing deliveries and all the things related, such as delivery mans, recipients and all the problems that could occur on a package delivery.

In there you can search for, list, edit, cancel, create and delete deliveries. You can perform all these operations on deliveryman and recipient records as well. It is a truly manager! üåü

_This project is the final challenge of the [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)'s GoStack bootcamp! üöÄ_

## üå¥ Implementation

The FastFeet layout was based on [this prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/62e829fc-4f10-4ac8-70d2-d39b429d43ee-14d9/grid). But it was implemented in a way that is fully **responsive** üì± and **accessible** ‚ôøÔ∏è.
